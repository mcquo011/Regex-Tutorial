  ## Description 

  Check out my [gist](https://github.com/mcquo011/Regex-Tutorial/blob/main/develop/regex-gist.md) describing the regular expression (regex) for matching email addresses. In this gist we'll break down the different components of the regex and provide examples of how it can be used. Whether you're building a contact form for your website or validating email addresses in your application, understanding how to use regex for email validation can be a valuable skill to have. 

  ## Usage 

Simply add the email regex to your regular expression code to use it in your project. For example, in JavaScript:

  const emailRegex = /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+)\.([a-z.]{2,6})$/;

  ## Supported Formats

  The email regex supports email addresses with the following format:

  maggie.mcquown@gmail.com

  Where the username is a combination of lowercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, or hyphens, the domain is a combination of digits, lowercase letters, periods, or hyphens, and com is a top-level domain consisting of two to six lowercase letters or periods.
